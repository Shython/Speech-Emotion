# Speech-Emotion Recognition Tool
I have used machine learning technique to train a model which is capable of predicting emotion from an file. The possible emotions that it can predict are happy,sad,surprised,calm,disgusted,angry,excited,neutral. 
The ML model used is MLP classifier with 3 layers. 300 neurons have been used. 
Dataset to train is Ravdess dataset from Kaggle.
It has a total of 1440 audio files from 12 male and 12 female actors. 
More details about the project is included in the ppt uploaded. 
Thank you for going through this!
